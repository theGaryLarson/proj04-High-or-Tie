# High or Tie
---
### A CSC143 class project
    A simple console game where dice are rolled by n amount of npc players. 
    The highest die wins while each successive player earns a strike.
    X number of strikes will result in a player being removed from the game.
    The game ends when there isone player left.

### Core Concept:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circular Linked List implementation & Adding .wav files to create sounds as extra credit.
The loop through the CLL ends when the game is won with one player remaining. Each losing player is removed via methods
implemented in my CLL class.
